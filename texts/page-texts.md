About Me (can toggle long and short versions)
Short ver.
I'm a computer science and mathematics student dedicated to growth. Look around to learn about my past experiences, projects, and hobbies! ദ്ദി ˉ͈̀꒳ˉ͈́ )✧

Long ver.
My fascination with the beauty of mathematics has always driven my passion for problem-solving. I bring those solutions to life through computer science, transforming ideas into tangible creations.

Aside from my academics, my current hobbies include: reading (reading list link), watching travel documentaries, and League of Legends.

While a lot of my learning comes from the classroom, I've also learned a lot from the many endeavors I've taken along the way. My projects showcase my various interests and hobbies persued throughout my personal journey.

Here are some technologies I've learned on my journey: Java, Javascript, C++, Python, Qisket

Work Experience:
The Sparks Foundation - As a remote intern, I participated in the Graduate Rotational Intern Program with a focus on Computer Vision & IoT in June 2023 and Data Science & Business Analytics in July 2023. Developed custom image processing algorithms for computer vision applications, created applications for facial and emotion recognition, and automated optical inspection. Used Raspberry Pi, Nvidia Jetson, and microcontrollers in IoT projects.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. - I worked in the AML/KYC team. I developed backend services using SpringBoot, Redis, and ElastiCache, enhacing performance and reducing response times. I implemented a Random Forest Classifier to streamline KYC derivations and collaborated in a hackathon to integrate innovative KYC functionality using Synthetic Data Vault. My intern project placed 2nd in end-of-summer presentations, and I ranked in the top 20% of U.S. and European tech interns in the Secure Code Competition. Additionally, I participated in Agile sprints, led discussions, and facilitated decisions to keep deliverables on track.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. - As an Academic Intern, I have contributed to the modernization of AML/KYC data systems by working with technologies like Apache Avro, AWS (Elasticache, Cassandra, and databases), and cloud services to optimize data processing and storage. I have been involved in designing and implementing data pipelines, utilizing Avro for schema management and serialization. I’ve also worked with AWS infrastructure, including Elasticache for caching and Cassandra for scalable, distributed data storage, helping to improve the performance and reliability of AML/KYC data workflows. Moving forward, I will build upon my intern project and develop an MVP to present to project owners, aiming to deliver a scalable and robust solution that meets business and regulatory requirements.
