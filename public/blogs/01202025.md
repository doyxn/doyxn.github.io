# Why a blog?

Why a blog?

I love reading. As shown on my book page, I love reading—though it doesn’t even list everything I’ve read. However, I've come to learn that in order to continue my growth as a reader, I should also write. 

This page gives my writing a home and a purpose — to be seen by others.

I briefly had it in mind to keep my notes and writing within a notes app or an untouched drive folder, but thought better. I believe that by keeping these writing samples public I might be inspired to keep my writing polished and professional.

Thank you for reading — A.A.F.
