        "description" : "As an Academic intern, I have contributed tot the modernization of AML/KYC data systems by working with technologies like Apache Avro and AWS (Elasticache, Cassandra, S3), to optimize data processing and storage. I have been involved in designing and implementing data pipelines, utilizing Avro for schema management and serialization. I've also worked with AWS infrastructure, including Elasticache for caching and Cassandra for scalable distributed data storage - helping to improve the performance and reliability of AML/KYC data workflows. Moving forwards, I will build upon my intern project and develop and MVP to present to project owners, aiming to deliver a scalable and robust solution that meets business and regulatory requirements."
